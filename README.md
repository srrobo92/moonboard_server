This project is an attempt to add functionality to the [repo](https://github.com/reinarrow/moonboard) that emulates the LED board on a raspberry pi. 

# What does this add?

This is a simple project scrapped together that is intented to let you make and save your own problems that don't have the same limitations that the moonboard app does. So you can pick any start holds and finish anywhere on the board. It runs as a web server hosted on the pi and should not interfere with the bluetooth connection, though that still needs to be tested.
